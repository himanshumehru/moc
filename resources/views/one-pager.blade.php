				<ul>
					<li>Watch the PCOF online training at www.pcof.us</li>
					<li>Observe  the same student four times during the 6 weeks using the PCOF</li>
					<li>Please ensure that you observe each of the following three sets of skills at least once during the first three observations. Remember that you may mark “observed but not performed” or “not observed.” </li>
				</ul>
   
    <ul>
    	<li>Beginning of visit: Establishing rapport; Collaborative upfront agenda setting</li>
    	<li>Data collection: Gathering information; Physical exam </li>
    	<li>End of visit: Sharing information; Co-creating a plan; Closure </li>
    </ul>


<p>Other skills are used at any point in the visit. You may observe them at any point, including </p>
<ul>
	<li>Maintaining efficiency using transparent thinking</li>
	<li>Maintaining the relationship </li>
	<li>Assessing patient or family perspective</li>
	<li>Electronic Medical Record Use</li>
	<li>Behavior Change and Self Management</li>
</ul>
<p>Please observe the student using the whole PCOF at least once</p>
<p>NOTE:  Prior to the sequence of observing the student four times, review the PCOF form with them.  Also let students know that they can choose subsets of these skills to focus on during three of the four observations. If the learner is trying a new skill, It may be helpful for the students to pick only 1-2 specific skills to practice during the observation. Focusing on specific skills does not preclude the student using others skills during any encounter or the observer rating skills other than those mentioned by the student.  However, encouraging the student to focus on subsets of skills decreases the chance that the student (or you) will feel overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Important principles of effective feedback:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Ask the student to reflect on how the encounter went, focusing on pre-determined skills to focus on</li>
	<li>Be specific in giving feedback</li>
	<li>Do not be judgementmental. Instead share objective observations and discuss benefits and risks of what you observed</li>
	<li>Highlight mastery and success as well as areas for improvement</li>
	<li>Reflect on your own use of one or skills and share your experience with the student if it seems appropriate and if time allows.</li>
</ol>
