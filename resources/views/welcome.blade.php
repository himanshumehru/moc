<p>
NOTE:  Prior to the sequence of observing the student four times, review the PCOF form with them.  Also let students know that they can choose subsets of these skills to focus on during three of the four observations. Focusing on specific skills does not preclude the student using others skills during any encounter or the observer rating skills other than those mentioned by the student.  However, encouraging the student to focus on subsets of skills decreases the chance that the student (or you) will feel overwhelmed.

<p>
Important principles of effective feedback:
<ol> 
    <li>Ask the student to reflect on how the encounter went, focusing on pre-determined skills to focus on</li>
    <li>    Be specific in giving feedback</li>
    <li>    Do not be judgementmental. Instead share objective observations and discuss benefits and risks of what you observed</li>
    <li>    Highlight mastery and success as well as areas for improvement</li>
    <li>    Reflect on your own use of one or skills and share your experience with the student if it seems appropriate and if time allows.</li>
</ol>
